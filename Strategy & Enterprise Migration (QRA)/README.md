# Quantum Security Readiness Index (QSRI) Assessment Tool

A comprehensive web-based assessment tool designed to evaluate an organization's readiness for quantum threats and cryptographic transitions.

## Overview

The Quantum Security Readiness Index (QSRI) is a standardized assessment framework that helps organizations:

- **Quantify** their preparedness for quantum threats
- **Benchmark** their security posture against industry standards
- **Prioritize** investments in post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
- **Track** progress across critical security dimensions

## Assessment Dimensions

The QSRI evaluates eight critical dimensions weighted by strategic importance:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Cryptographic Inventory & Discovery** | 15% | Visibility over where cryptography is used in the organization |
| **Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis** | 10% | Understanding which assets and data are vulnerable to quantum threats |
| **Policy & Governance** | 10% | Leadership commitment, PQC strategy, and governance model |
| **Technology & Crypto Agility** | 15% | Ability to upgrade or swap cryptography with minimal disruption |
| **Migration Planning & Execution** | 20% | Defined strategy, timeline, and pilot migrations |
| **Vendor & Supply Chain Readiness** | 10% | Ensuring partners and products support PQC transition |
| **Regulatory & Compliance Alignment** | 10% | Alignment with national and international standards |
| **Awareness & Workforce Training** | 10% | Internal capacity building and training on quantum risks |

## Features

### Interactive Assessment Interface
- **Real-time scoring** with dynamic updates as you adjust maturity levels
- **Visual radar chart** displaying maturity across all dimensions
- **Progressive bar charts** showing score distribution
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile devices

### Comprehensive Reporting
- **PDF export** functionality for assessment reports
- **Score interpretation** with readiness level classification
- **Detailed breakdowns** by dimension with actionable insights
- **Professional formatting** suitable for executive presentations

### Maturity Framework
- **6-level maturity scale** (0-5) from Unaware to Quantum-Safe Ready
- **Weighted scoring** system (0-100 total score)
- **Readiness classification** (Unprepared, Early-stage, Progressing, Mature)
- **Clear progression paths** for each dimension

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAMeh-ZAGhloul/Quantum-Security-Readiness-Index.git
   cd Quantum-Security-Readiness-Index
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   Simply open `qsri-assessment.html` in any modern web browser. No build process required!

3. **Start assessing**
   - Review the current maturity levels (pre-populated with example data)
   - Adjust maturity levels using the dropdown selectors
   - Watch scores update in real-time
   - Generate PDF reports for documentation

### Using the Assessment

1. **Evaluate each dimension** by selecting the appropriate maturity level (0-5)
2. **Review your total score** and readiness classification
3. **Analyze the radar chart** to identify strengths and weaknesses
4. **Export results** to PDF for reporting and planning
5. **Track progress** over time by repeating the assessment

## Understanding Your Results

### Maturity Levels

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **0** | Unaware | No awareness of quantum threats; no action taken |
| **1** | Aware | Basic awareness; no formal program or inventory |
| **2** | Initiating | Initial assessments or inventories are in progress |
| **3** | Planning | Roadmaps, governance, and testbeds defined |
| **4** | Migrating | Pilot PQC/hybrid crypto deployments in production |
| **5** | Quantum-Safe Ready | Full cryptographic agility and PQC adoption |

### Readiness Classifications

| Score Range | Classification | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **0-25** | Unprepared | Critical risk; no quantum defense strategy |
| **26-50** | Early-stage | Awareness stage; significant work required |
| **51-75** | Progressing | Partial readiness with some implementation |
| **76-100** | Mature | Quantum-safe ready with strong governance |
