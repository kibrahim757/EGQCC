Simulation plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between theoretical security and practical implementation. Quantum network simulators enable the evaluation of protocol behavior under realistic physical constraints.

## Motivation for Simulation

Analytical models often rely on idealized assumptions. Simulation allows:

- Evaluation of noise and loss effects
- Measurement of QBER under varying conditions
- Performance comparison across configurations

## Simulation Frameworks

Two widely used quantum network simulators are:

- **NetSquid**: A discrete-event simulator optimized for quantum network protocols.
- **QuNetSim**: A high-level framework focused on protocol prototyping and experimentation.

## Simulation Model

A typical BB84 simulation includes:

- Quantum nodes representing Alice and Bob
- A quantum channel with configurable loss and noise
- Classical authenticated communication

## Performance Metrics

Key metrics evaluated during simulation include:

- Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)
- Key generation rate
- Communication latency

## Simulation Outcomes

Simulation results provide insight into the feasibility of BB84 under realistic conditions and guide hardware design and protocol optimization.
